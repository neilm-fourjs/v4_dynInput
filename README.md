# v4_dynInput

This is a demo for Genero 4.00 that uses the reflect package to introspect a record structure and build a dynamic input statement.

This demo is standalone demo uses a supplied sqlite database.

The demo has two maintenance programs:
* cstmnt : This uses 3 records for the input, the 'customer' record plus two 'addresses' records.
* stkmnt : This is a simple example using a single record, 'stock'

NOTE: The demo is only demostrating the 'input' for the 'update' function, it does not update the demo database.
